   * handing every customer a working key billed to us. Verified by scanning
   * a real release build; guarded now by scripts/check-bundle-secrets.mjs,
   * which runs as part of `npm run build`.
   *
   * Packaged builds have no env fallback by design: keys come from the OS
   * keychain via Tauri (see src/providers/keys.ts).
