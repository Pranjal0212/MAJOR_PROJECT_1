/**
 * Groq voice as a degraded fallback, NOT a peer of Gemini Live.
 *
 * When a Gemini key runs out of quota mid-interview the session is simply
 * over: the candidate is left talking into a dead socket twenty minutes in,
 * and the report keeps whatever it happened to collect. A slower interviewer
 * is unambiguously better than that, so this exists to finish the hour.
 *
 * It is a pipeline — transcribe, generate, speak — where Gemini Live is one
 * hop. Three sequential round trips cannot match 544 ms, and this file does
 * not pretend otherwise; it is chosen only when the alternative is nothing.
 * The honest costs:
 *
 *  - Turn-taking is ours to detect (see vad.ts) rather than the server's.
 *  - It cannot see. Gemini Live accepts video frames; there is no vision hop
 *    here, so sendVideo is deliberately absent rather than a no-op that
 *    silently discards the camera the candidate chose to turn on.
 *  - Barge-in cancels playback and the in-flight request, but a sentence
 *    already handed to the speaker finishes.
