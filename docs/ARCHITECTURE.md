# Architecture

Desktop app: **Tauri 2** (Rust shell) + **React + TypeScript** (UI and all
domain logic). Rust is kept thin — window, OS keychain, SQLite, file
dialogs, (later) sandboxed code execution. Everything product-shaped lives
in TypeScript.

## 1. Interview Engine — the heart of the product

Models the interview the way a senior interviewer runs it. Two cooperating
pieces:

### Stage machine

The six stages (intro → resume discussion → project deep-dive → technical →
behavioral → wrap-up/report) as an explicit state machine, not a prompt.
Each stage owns:

- entry criteria and target duration,
- what the interviewer is trying to *learn* in this stage,
- exit criteria (learned enough / time budget spent).

### Socratic depth controller

The differentiator. For each answer, the engine (via a fast LLM call)
assesses: was the answer strong, shallow, evasive, wrong? Then it decides:

- **strong** → drill one layer deeper (why this architecture? what failed?
  what trade-offs?) — up to a per-topic depth budget,
- **shallow/struggling** → probe once more gently, then move laterally,
- **exhausted** → surface to the next topic/stage.

Each drill-down is tracked as a `Thread` (topic, depth reached, quality of
answers) — this becomes the raw material for the report.

The decision itself (`engine/depth.ts`) is a **pure function, not a prompt**.
"Keep drilling until the candidate hits their limit, then ease off" is the
one behaviour that must never drift, and prompts drift. As code it is
testable, tunable, and identical in every session.

### Steering: why the controller cannot dictate each question

A native-audio model answers autonomously — measured at **544 ms** from
end-of-speech to first audio. Assessment takes **~1.9 s**. So the engine
*cannot* assess an answer and compose the next question before the
interviewer must already be speaking. Blocking on it would destroy the
544 ms that makes the product feel human — i.e. the whole bet.

The resolution splits the work by timescale:

- **The persona drills** (`engine/persona.ts`). The Live model is instructed
  to be natively Socratic, so layer-by-layer follow-ups happen *in the
  conversation*, at conversational latency, with no engine round-trip.
- **The engine steers** (`engine/depth.ts` + `updateContext`). Assessment
  runs async and shapes the *next* turn: stage transitions, "you've drilled
  this three layers, move on", "the candidate is struggling — ease off",
  "probe this project's precomputed angles next".

This means steering lags by one turn. That is acceptable — a human
interviewer also re-plans between questions, not mid-sentence — and it is
the only design that preserves both the drilling and the latency.

Consequence: assessment latency has slack (it is off the critical path), so
the assessment model is chosen for **judgement quality**, not raw speed.

### Candidate model

A running structured summary of what the interview has revealed (claims
made, verified strengths, exposed gaps), updated after each exchange and
injected into the interviewer's context. This is what makes stage 4
questions reference stage 2 answers naturally.

## 2. Resume pipeline

`PDF/DOCX → text extraction → LLM structuring → SQLite`

Parsed into typed sections: contact, summary, experience[], projects[],
skills[], education[]. Stored locally; the engine pulls relevant sections
into context per stage (whole resume is small enough to include, but
structured sections let the engine *target* — e.g. pick the two most
technically interesting projects for stage 3).

## 3. Provider layer (BYOK, pluggable)

```ts
interface Provider {
  id: string
  capabilities: { realtimeVoice: boolean; text: boolean }
  text(session): TextChannel               // chat-completions style, streaming
  voice?(session): RealtimeVoiceChannel    // bidirectional audio, barge-in
}
```

- **Gemini**: realtimeVoice (Live API, WebSocket, native speech-to-speech)
  + text. Launch flagship for the human-like p95 experience.
- **Grok**: text tier → voice via the fallback pipeline
  (pluggable STT → Grok → pluggable TTS e.g. ElevenLabs, also BYOK).
- **Others**: anyone implementing `Provider` plugs in; config-driven
  OpenAI-compatible adapter covers most text providers for free.

Keys: entered in settings → stored in **OS keychain** via Rust
(never in SQLite, never in config files). All provider traffic goes
device → provider directly.

Two model roles per session, independently configurable:
- **conversation model** (realtime voice, does the interviewing),
- **reasoning model** (cheap/fast text calls: answer assessment, candidate
  model updates, report generation). Can be the same provider or different.

## 4. Voice layer

- Mic capture + playback via Web Audio in the webview.
- `RealtimeVoiceChannel` abstracts: push mic frames, receive audio frames,
  interruption events (user barge-in cancels TTS/generation), and parallel
  text transcripts (needed for the transcript log + candidate model).
- Latency budget (p95): capture→provider ≤ 100ms, provider first-audio
  ≤ 800ms, playback start ≤ 100ms.

## 5. DSA / coding rounds

- In-app code editor (Monaco) with language selector.
- v1: code is sent to the reasoning model; interviewer discusses it over
  voice (complexity, edge cases, bugs) — Socratic controller applies.
- v1.x: "Run" button → Rust side executes in a resource-limited sandboxed
  subprocess (time/memory caps, no network) against test cases.

## 6. Report generator

Consumes: full transcript, all `Thread`s (topics × depth × quality), the
candidate model, and code artifacts. Produces the structured report
(project depth, technical knowledge, behavioral fit, communication,
strengths, weaknesses, readiness, actionable improvements) → stored in
SQLite, rendered in-app, exportable to PDF.

## 7. Data (SQLite, local)

```
resumes(id, raw_text, parsed_json, created_at)
sessions(id, resume_id, config_json, started_at, ended_at)
turns(id, session_id, role, text, audio_meta, stage, ts)
threads(id, session_id, topic, depth, quality_json)
reports(id, session_id, report_json, created_at)
```
